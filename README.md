# PFree-Thesis
This is a repository for my work on my senior thesis for Reed College from the 2022-2023 academic year. This thesis and repository expand upon and explore the work presented by Boucher et, al. in their 2019 paper: "Prefix-free parsing for building big BWTs".

## Thesis Document Work
All work on the actual thesis document will be available under the folder [thesis](https://github.com/rqberry/PFree-Thesis/tree/main/thesis).

## Thesis Code Work
All coding work for this thesis will be available under the folder [pfree-code](https://github.com/rqberry/PFree-Thesis/tree/main/pfree-code).

## Important: Work and Citations
This repo is intended at this point to be a work-in-progress for my thesis, since this is the case, most necessary citations will likely be included in the current draft pdf of my thesis. This work is intended for academic purposes only, not all code is my own (e.g. [gsa](https://github.com/rqberry/PFree-Thesis/tree/main/pfree-code/gsa)), and in the early stages of this repo likely a largre amount of the code will be poorly documented.
